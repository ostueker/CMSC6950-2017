  Intersession 2017

**Lectures**:​ Wednesdays and Fridays 9am-12pm in room C2039 (First Lecture May 10, 2017)

## Instructors:

* Oliver Stueker

* Ivan Saika-Voivod

## Course Description:

  Using computers in research computing requires a diverse set of skills and tools for the
  research to be effective and efficient. The goal of this practical six-week intersession course is
  to increase your level of proficiency with using computers to do research in science.
  Computing in research often gets applied with one of two approaches. Some researchers
  develop new code and have to consider the technical details of numerical analysis and software
  engineering. Other researchers use proven applications that provide a predefined user
  interface and have established work flows. This course sits at the interface between those
  approaches and will cover how to build new programs from other software and libraries. It will
  also develop automation of research work flows for passing data between different software
  applications.
